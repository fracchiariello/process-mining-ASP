\section{Experiment instructions}
The experiment have been performed using the ASP solver  clingo version 5.4.0. Please refer to \url{github.com/potassco/clingo} for downloading and installing clingo. \\

For executing log generation is required to pass to clingo a generation encoding file, a model file, the templates, the value of the parameter \texttt{t} corresponding to the length of the traces, and the number of desired answer sets, i.e the log size. For example you can run

\texttt{clingo generation\_encoding\_data.lp reference3\_data.lp activities.lp templates.lp -c t=10 10000}

or

\texttt{clingo generation\_encoding.lp 2012\_80.lp templates.lp -c t=10 10000}

making sure that the files are in the current directory or to pass the appropriate path. The clingo output can then be converted into an XES file (see \texttt{lp2xes.py} in \emph{utils}).\\

For executing conformance checking is required to pass to clingo a conformance encoding, a log, a model file, and the templates. For example you can run

\texttt{clingo conformance\_encoding.lp  BPI\_Challenge\_2012.asp 2012\_80.lp templates.lp}

It will return the unique answer set indicating the pairs trace/constraint such that the constraint is satisfied by the trace (and so the unsatisfied ones by exclusion).\\

For executing query checking is required to pass to clingo the query encoding, a log, a query, some conditions, the set of activities and the templates. For example you can run 

\texttt{clingo  query\_encoding\_data.lp  length\_10.lp query.lp conditions.lp activities.lp templates.lp 0}

where 0 instructs clingo to return all the assignments.
